                <h2>C++</h2>
                <p>C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”.
                   In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.

                <h3>Where did it start ?</h3>
                <p>Released in 1983 and often considered an object-oriented version of C language, C++ was created to compile lean, efficient code, while providing high-level abstractions to better manage large development projects.</p>

                <h3>What makes learning it important ?</h3>
                <p>The C++ language is used to create computer programs and packaged software, such as games, office applications, graphics and video editors and operating systems.
                The Blackberry OS and the newest Microsoft Office suite were developed using C++<br />

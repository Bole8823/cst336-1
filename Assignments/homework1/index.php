            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.<br />
               Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary". <br />

               Translating programming language into binary is known as "compiling". Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.<br />

               These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.<br />
               For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.</p>

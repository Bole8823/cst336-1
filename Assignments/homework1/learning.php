                <h2>Wich programming language should you learn ?</h2><br /> 
                <p>Lots of people get into programming because they love the challenge, are excited by computers and want to build a career creating websites, mobile apps or desktop programs.
                But even if you don't want to become a programmer for a living, it's still worth your time to learn how to program.
                But more than just solving daily work problems, programming is fun. It's problem solving at its best. In fact, it's really fun to come up with a program - no matter how simple - to solve an every day problem.

                In other words: you don't need to dedicate your career to programming to add programming to your career. Start learning a language like Python, JavaScript, Ruby or Java today and you could very well be making your life easier, while having fun doing it.
